## üöÄ Getting Started

Each project contains its own README with detailed setup instructions. Generally, you'll need:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js 18+ and pnpm (or Bun for the API)
   - PostgreSQL database (for dreamcoins-main)
   - Redis server (for dreamcoins-api-main)

2. **Basic Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   
   # Navigate to desired project
   cd dream-computer-main  # or dreamcoins-main or dreamcoins-api-main
   
   # Install dependencies
   pnpm install  # or bun install for API
   
   # Configure environment variables
   cp .env.example .env.local
   
   # Run development server
   pnpm dev  # or bun dev for API
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   Each project includes a `.env.example` file with placeholder values. Replace these with your own API keys, wallet addresses, and service credentials.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The ecosystem consists of three interconnected components:

```
dream/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dream-computer-main/     # Marketing and information site
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dreamcoins-main/         # Main user-facing application
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dreamcoins-api-main/     # Backend API and bot services
```

These projects can be deployed independently or work together as a complete token launcher platform.

## üîí Security Notes

- All wallet addresses and API keys have been extracted to environment variables
- Use the provided `.env.example` files as templates
- Never commit sensitive information to the repository
- All token deployments go through audited WoW protocol contracts
